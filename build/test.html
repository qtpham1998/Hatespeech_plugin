                In the world of television it is generally accepted that “losing one’s shit” is frowned upon and most
                television producers actively work to avoid it. Producers on&nbsp;<em>The Chase&nbsp;</em>are an apparent
                exception to this rule since they spend a considerable amount of their time trying to fuck with host
                Bradley Walsh.&nbsp;

            <p>
                If you’re not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Chase&nbsp;</em>it’s in the simplest sense a quiz show where a
                team composed of members of the public will answer questions in an attempt to win some money. The twist
                (because there’s always a twist with these shows) is that contestants are “chased” by a seasoned quiz
                champion and general knowledge buff who will attempt to answer more questions than they do. Part of the
                show’s draw is that all of these Chasers as they’re known are given flamboyant, over the top personalities
                and nicknames like The Beast or The Dark Destroyer.

            <p>Now initially the show got off to a rocky start and despite the best efforts of the cast, ratings weren’t
                that great. This all changed in 2011 when Walsh, the show’s host, absolutely began to lose his shit when
                the question “<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl1Zfz-Widc">In what sport does&nbsp;Fanny
                    Chmelar compete for Germany</a>?</em>” popped up on screen.

            <p>The question immediately put Walsh on his arse and the show ground to halt for several minutes as he tried
                to compose himself, footage the producers decided against cutting because they, like everyone on set that
                day found it fucking hilarious. As expected, the moment was a hit with viewers and clips of Walsh losing
                his shit immediately went viral. A fact that wasn’t lost on producers or the question setters for the show
                that decided to capitalise on the influx of new viewers tuning in to see Walsh laughing his hole off.

Why not cram as many questions with dirty sounding answers into the show as possible to try and catch him out?

                Walsh has since gotten wise to this and reportedly has to steel himself before each round of questions in
                an attempt to stop himself laughing. Amusingly, other contestants and even the Chasers have tried to get in
                on the action, making innuendo-laden comments to Walsh to try and get him to lose his shit, usually with
                great success because literally the entire show’s format has been slowly tilted specifically to fuck with
                him.
